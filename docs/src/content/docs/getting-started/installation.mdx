This guide will help you get Kemono Scraper installed on your computer. Don't worry, it's easier than it sounds!

## Option 1: Download Pre-built Executable (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started. You just download a file and run it.

### Step 1: Find Your System Type

First, figure out which version you need:

| Your Computer | Download This File |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Windows (most common) | `kemono-scraper-windows-x64.exe` |
| Mac with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) | `kemono-scraper-darwin-arm64` |
| Mac with Intel chip | `kemono-scraper-darwin-x64` |
| Linux | `kemono-scraper-linux-x64` |

:::tip[Not sure which Mac you have?]
Click the Apple menu () at the top left of your screen, then click "About This Mac". If it says "Apple M1" or "Apple M2", you have Apple Silicon. Otherwise, you have Intel.
:::

### Step 2: Download the File

Choose between the **latest stable release** or the **nightly build** (bleeding edge, built from the latest commit):

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or browse all releases on the [Releases page](https://github.com/3dnsfw/kemono-scraper/releases).

### Step 3: Prepare the File

#### On Windows
The file is ready to use! You might want to move it to its own folder.

#### On Mac or Linux
You need to make the file "executable" (tell your computer it's a program):

1. Open **Terminal** (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight on Mac)
2. Type this command and press Enter:

```bash
chmod +x ~/Downloads/kemono-scraper-darwin-arm64
```

Replace the file name with the one you downloaded.

:::note
On Mac, you might see a security warning the first time you run it. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and click "Allow Anyway".

## Option 2: Run from Source Code

If you're more technical and want to run the latest code:

### Prerequisites
